    <p>Note: If you planing to go to Bahamas on a cruise by yourself I reomend you to go in Nowrigian,

        Is you are going with your family or ouple and looking for something more chill Royal Caribbian is the way to go
        <br>
        Allways try to awoid other cruise lines.

    <ul>
        <li>Atlantis</li>
        <p>Note: Atlantis is a amazing places to viset and eat, but the water park is not worth for the price</p>
